Small scale fading characterizes the fluctuation of signal (strength) over a spatial distance of fraction of wavelength. The fluctuation is also observed 
in both time and frequency domain at a gain location. The variation of signal (strength) at the receiver is due to random interference between the different copies 
of the transmitted signal. The interference is sometimes constructive and sometimes destructive. The multiple copies of the transmitted signal are generated due to 
scattering, reflection, and diffraction due to obstacle present in the path of radio signal between the Tx and Rx movement of the Tx and Rx or the obstacle cause 
time domain variation of the signal (strength) and the phenomenon is called Doppler effect. Since each path of the radio wave may exhibit difference doppler its 
cumulative effect results in spread of the carrier/ frequency content of the signal and hence is also known as Doppler spread
