Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a standardized client/server network protocol that dynamically assigns IP addresses and other related configuration 
information to network devices. Every device on a TCP/IP-based network must have a unique unicast IP address to access the networkand its resources. 
Without DHCP, IP addresses for new computers or computers that are moved from one subnet to another must be configured manually.
